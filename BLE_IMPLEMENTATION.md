# OneWheel BLE Integration Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented comprehensive Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) integration for the OneWheel Flutter app, enabling real-time communication with physical OneWheel boards while maintaining backward compatibility with dummy data for development and testing.

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. OneWheel BLE Service (`lib/services/onewheel_ble_service.dart`)
- **Complete BLE Protocol Implementation**: Based on reverse-engineered OneWheel protocols from GitHub research
- **Authentication System**: MD5-based challenge-response handshake with known OneWheel password
- **Real-time Data Streaming**: Continuous monitoring of all OneWheel characteristics
- **Automatic Reconnection**: Periodic unlock renewal every 20 seconds
- **Service UUID**: `e659f300-ea98-11e3-ac10-0800200c9a66` (primary OneWheel service)

#### Supported Data Characteristics:
- **Speed & Motion**: RPM, speed conversion (km/h to MPH)
- **Battery**: Percentage, voltage, current, charging status
- **Temperature**: Motor and controller temperatures (°C to °F conversion)
- **Orientation**: Pitch, roll, yaw values
- **Distance**: Trip and lifetime odometer (km to miles conversion)
- **Mode**: Ride mode detection (Classic, Extreme, Elevated, etc.)

### 2. Connection Management (`lib/screens/onewheel_connection_screen.dart`)
- **Device Discovery**: Bluetooth scanning with OneWheel service filtering
- **Connection Interface**: User-friendly device selection and pairing
- **Status Monitoring**: Real-time connection and unlock status
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error reporting and recovery

### 3. Integrated Dashboard (`lib/screens/dashboard_screen.dart`)
- **Dynamic Data Source**: Automatically switches between BLE data and dummy data
- **Real-time Updates**: Live display of OneWheel telemetry when connected
- **Connection Status**: Visual indicator of BLE connection state
- **US Unit Conversion**: All metrics displayed in Imperial units (MPH, °F, miles)

### 4. Data Provider Integration (`lib/providers/ride_provider.dart`)
- **BLE Service Integration**: Seamless connection between BLE service and app state
- **Automatic Data Conversion**: Real-time conversion from metric to Imperial units
- **State Management**: Provider pattern for reactive UI updates
- **Fallback Handling**: Graceful degradation to dummy data when disconnected

### 5. Enhanced Data Models (`lib/models/onewheel_stats.dart`)
- **Extended Properties**: Added charging status, trip distance, lifetime distance, ride mode
- **Type Safety**: Proper typing for all OneWheel data fields
- **US Unit Support**: Built-in Imperial unit generation for dummy data

## Technical Implementation Details

### BLE Protocol Implementation
- **Service Discovery**: Automatic detection of OneWheel service characteristics
- **Data Parsing**: 16-bit little-endian value conversion
- **Scale Factors**: Proper scaling for voltage (0.1), current (0.002), orientation (0.1)
- **Formula Accuracy**: Speed conversion using 917.66mm wheel circumference

### Authentication Flow
1. **Firmware Reading**: Initial firmware revision characteristic read
2. **Challenge Reception**: UART read characteristic monitoring
3. **Response Generation**: MD5 hash of challenge + known password
4. **Authentication Completion**: Response transmission via UART write
5. **Periodic Renewal**: Automatic unlock maintenance

### Error Handling & Resilience
- **Connection Timeouts**: 15-second connection timeout with user feedback
- **Service Validation**: Verification of OneWheel service availability
- **Graceful Fallback**: Automatic switch to dummy data during disconnection
- **User Notifications**: Toast messages for connection status changes

## Integration Points

### Settings Screen
- **BLE Connection Entry**: Direct access to OneWheel connection interface
- **Status Display**: Real-time connection status with device name
- **Quick Connect**: One-tap access to connection screen

### Main Dashboard
- **Connection Indicator**: Bluetooth icon with status color coding
- **Real Data Display**: Live telemetry when OneWheel is connected
- **Seamless Transition**: No UI changes when switching data sources

## Dependencies Added
```yaml
flutter_blue_plus: ^1.35.5  # Primary BLE package for Flutter
crypto: ^3.0.3               # MD5 hashing for authentication
```

## Platform Support
- **Mobile (Android/iOS)**: Full BLE functionality
- **Desktop (Linux/Windows/macOS)**: Development mode with dummy data
- **Cross-platform Compatibility**: Graceful degradation on platforms without BLE

## Future Enhancement Opportunities
1. **Data Logging**: Persistent storage of BLE telemetry
2. **Advanced Diagnostics**: Detailed motor and battery analysis
3. **Firmware Updates**: OTA update capability via BLE
4. **Multi-board Support**: Connection to multiple OneWheels
5. **Custom Ride Modes**: Board configuration via app

## Development & Testing
- **Dummy Data Mode**: Continues to work for development without physical board
- **Real-time Switching**: Automatic detection of BLE availability
- **Debug Logging**: Comprehensive logging for troubleshooting
- **Error Recovery**: Robust handling of connection failures

## Security Considerations
- **Known Password**: Uses reverse-engineered OneWheel authentication
- **Local Processing**: All authentication happens on-device
- **No Cloud Dependency**: Direct board-to-app communication

This implementation provides a complete foundation for OneWheel board connectivity while maintaining the app's existing functionality and user experience.
